    piplelines_adbapi.py

    Altered the 'pipelines.py' file to integrate with
    Twisted RDBMS support with adbapi.

    From the Abstract:
        Twisted is an asynchronous networking framework, but most database API
        implementations unfortunately have blocking interfaces -- for this reason, twisted.
        enterprise.adbapi was created. It is a non-blocking interface to the standardized
        DB-API 2.0 API, which allows you to access a number of different RDBMSes.
